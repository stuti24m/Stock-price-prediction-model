# Stock-price-prediction-model
ðŸ¤“Stock price prediction model using LSTM (Long short-term memory)

LSTMs are very powerful in sequence prediction problems because, they can store the past information, which is important in our case. 
After all, the previous price of a stock is important in predicting its future price.
